    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to
        understand how we collect, use, communicate, and disclose and make use of personal information.
        Some of this information is collected automatically, while other information is provided by you.
        By visiting upnext.fm (https://upnext.fm), you agree to allow upnext.fm to collect and use the information
        in the manner described in this policy.

    <h2>Collected Automatically</h2>
    <h4>Browser Information</h4>
    <p>
        When you visit upnext.fm, certain information is automatically sent by your browser, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your IP (Internet Protocol) address, which may be associated with an Internet Service Provider and country of residence
        </li>
        <li>
            The name and version of the browser you are connecting with (User-Agent string)
        </li>
        <li>
            The page or resource you are requesting
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is not shared with third parties, except if you consent to disclosure or we are required
        by law to disclose this information.  Your IP address may be logged and used to identify you for
        administrative purposes, such as revoking access to abusive users.  It may also be used in aggregation of
        anonymous statistics.  Your browser's name and version number (User-Agent string) may be used to provide
        content best suited for your device, in the case of resources which have multiple representations.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
        Certain information, such as authentication tokens used to identify your account after logging in, and your
        theme preference are stored in "cookies" on your browser. This information is sent to upnext.fm's servers
        automatically when you request a page. The login cookie is used to verify your identity with respect to your
        account, and the theme cookie is used to present the page using your preferred theme. Neither cookie is
        explicitly shared with third parties, however it is possible they may be observed by an intermediary,
        especially if you are browsing on an insecure network.
    </p>
    
    <h4>localStorage</h4>
    <p>
        Information about your website preferences, such as those configurable from the Options dialog on a channel
        page, is stored in your browser via the HTML5 localStorage interface.  This information is used to persist
        your desired settings across multiple sessions on the website.  This information is not explicitly shared
        with third parties, however any entity which has access to your browser, including userscripts, may read or
        modify it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Provided by You</h2>
    <h4>Account Information</h4>
    <p>
        In order to register an account, you must provide the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>
            A password.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your username and password will be stored on upnext.fm's servers and used for the purposes of authentication.
        Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage; at no time is the plain password recorded in persistent storage.
        Usernames and passwords are never shared with third parties, to the extent permitted by United States law.

        <li>

        <li>
            A brief profile summary (text)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of this information is stored on upnext.fm's servers. Your email address will only be used for the
        purposes of verifying your identity in case you are unable to login to your account. It is not shared with
        third parties, nor will it be used to communicate arbitrary information to you. Your profile image and summary
